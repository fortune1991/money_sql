def instructions():

In this program, your savings are organized into two categories: Vaults and Pots.

- A Vault is a collection of Pots, each assigned a specific time frame.
- A Pot represents an individual budget within a Vault.

For example, between 17/03/25 and 17/01/26, you might create a 'Travelling' Vault
to manage your holiday expenses. This Vault could contain multiple Pots, each
representing a budget for a different destination.

Once you've set up your Vaults and Pots, the program will enter an infinite loop
where you can choose from three options:

1. Submit a transaction – Transactions are linked to a specific Pot and either 
increase or decrease its balance, depending on the selected type.
2. View a summary – This provides an updated overview of your Vaults and Pots, 
reflecting any transactions you've made.
3. Exit the program – A final summary of your balances will be displayed before 
the program closes.
4. Create a new vault - will be associated with the user currently logged in
5. Create a new pot - will be associated with the user currently logged in

Please note: This program does not store data permanently. Once you exit, all 
Vault and Pot data will be lost.

We hope you enjoy using Money Pots!
